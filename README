KECODE sequence:
  # Configure Project 
  require './lib/setenv.rb'
  include SetEnv
  
  # Require all important files from library
  require 'click.rb'
  
  # Run test
  click = Events::Click.new
  click.create
  click.add(:KEYCODE_DPAD_RIGHT)
  click.add(:KEYCODE_DPAD_RIGHT)
  click.add(:KEYCODE_DPAD_CENTER)
  click.add(:KEYCODE_DPAD_LEFT)
  click.add(:KEYCODE_DPAD_LEFT)
  click.send_text(1234)
  click.run
  
EVENT sequence:
  #Configure Project
  require './lib/setenv.rb'
  include SetEnv
  
  # Require all importan files from library
  require 'touch.rb'
  touch = Events::Touch.new
  
  # Record events
  touch.create
  seq = touch.record(10)
  seq += touch.record(10, :drag_and_drop)
  seq += touch.record(10, :drag_and_drop)
  
  # Create sequence and run it
  touch.add seq
  touch.run
